# Learning C at 42Lisboa 💥 (and hopefully many other things)

With absolutely no previous experience, I decided to undertake the [42Lisboa](https://www.42lisboa.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhf2MBhDNARIsAKXU5GTwlWzL_VEhqeYVXxQwIpnN_1YgvWYSxiYDNNdDPZnuX9aSCzYC0O8aAlBdEALw_wcB)'s 26 day bootcamp - _the piscine_ - after procrastinatig for a college exam by doing the online tests, as a joke 🤫
The piscine taught me a lot - not just the basis of C, but something _**much more**_ than that.


### And what is that, may you ask?
Only a few weeks away from getting a diploma in Business Management, I realized it was not for me - _at all_. The curiosity for programing did not start up until the very first day of the piscine. And from that moment on, I am learning about something that actually gives me pleasure 🌞 (and frustration from time to time, but I heard it's a part of it 🤷🏻‍♀️)
